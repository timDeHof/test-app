This could be a pretty hefty front and back end project. Potential front end items could be JS, React, a CSS framework like bootstrap or material UI, State Managment like Redux, Real-time Updates handled with WebSockets. Potential Back end(Writing this based on my knowledge/items I would need to research more) Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL, User authentication and Authorization with bcrypt and sessions/cookies, websockets with actionCable, and if we got far enough to implement something like notifications then we would also need to set up background jobs. |           |     | X    | X              |         |     |
